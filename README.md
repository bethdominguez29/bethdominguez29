- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bethdominguez29 and am currently half way through an edX 9-course series on Data Science so I am very new to all of this.
It has been very interesting to learn some basics of R, probability, inference and modeling, and now about Github. I want to better understand how data science can be helpful to advance treatments for pediatric cancers.
